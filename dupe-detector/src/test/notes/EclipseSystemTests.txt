# These are the notes for command line arguments provided for system testing when using Eclipse. 
# These same arguments can be applied to normal command line interface, although file execution is expected.

//User provides duplicate directory
App - Duplicate Directory

# Currently duplicates will be read twice in regards to the print report. Should probably add lock to prevent duplicates.


//Basically same as duplicate directory above but check to see if it causes any problems scanning in many more files
App - Duplicate Directory (Many)
