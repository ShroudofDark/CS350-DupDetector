# These same arguments can be applied to normal command line interface, although file execution is expected.
# Will include any observations or possible errors if necessary.

//User provides duplicate directory
App - Duplicate Directory

# Currently duplicates will be read twice in regards to the print report. Should probably add lock to prevent duplicates.


//Normal input expected with numSuggestions, a property file, and at least a code file
App - Expected

//Normal input, property file is empty so it should be using defaults
App - Expected (Empty Property File)

//Normal input, with high amount of suggestions not having a baring on ouput
App - Expected (High Suggestions)

//Normal input expected, but numSuggestions is low to examine the result of the last line of the report
App - Expected (Low Suggestions)

//Normal input, but only one file instead of a directory
App - Expected Individual File


//Normal input expected, provides multiple optional directories
App - Expected MultiDirectory

//User provides no arguments, should throw error

//Property file provided doesn't exist, should throw error

//Tests that if individual file is added to list it still is scanned, as CppExtensions should only effect directory searching

//Tests when directory doesn't exist, should throw error
App - Source File Directory Doesn't Exist

# Same issue as with source file doesn't exist


//Tests when individual file provided doesn't exist, should throw error
App - Source File Doesn't Exist
50  src/test/data/ini/demoPropFile.ini src/test/data/cpp/hello-worldNoExist.cpp

# As of typing up this test, it doesn't seem to throw an error. Program continues as normal, so report prints no file scanned


//Tests when an individual file provided doesn't exist while there exist a file that does, should throw error

# Given an error is not being thrown, only the existing file is actually scanned.
