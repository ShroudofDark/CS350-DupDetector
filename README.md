Code for the `Token`, `TokenKinds`, `TokenStream` classes  was adapted from
examples provided in Dr. Zeil's
[Jflex example repository](https://git.cs.odu.edu/zeil/jflexdemo/-/tree/master).

The Jflex specification in `src/main/jflex/demo.jflex` is adapted from the example
repository.

Further, [Dr. Zeil's Design notes](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs350/f21/Protected/refactoringDesign/index.html#lexical-analysis)
have guided the implementation.

Adapted code is marked as such by source code comments.
